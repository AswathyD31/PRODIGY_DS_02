# **Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech**

## **Task 2 Submission:**

Welcome to my submission for Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech.
In this task, I performed Data cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the classic Titanic dataset, uncovering key patterns and creating insightful visualizations to better understand the factors that influenced survival.

## Dataset Description
____________

The Titanic dataset contains passenger details such as demographics, ticket information, and survival status from the tragic sinking of the Titanic.

### Key Columns:

* **Survived:** Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

* **Pclass:** Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

* **Sex:** Gender

* **Age:** Age of the passenger

* **SibSp:** Number of siblings/spouses aboard

* **Parch:** Number of parents/children aboard

* **Fare:** Fare paid for the ticket

* **Embarked:** Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Tools and Libraries Used
__________________
 * Jupyter Notebook

* Pandas for data manipulation

* NumPy for numerical operations

* Matplotlib & Seaborn for creating visualizations

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Process
________________
Key steps followed during the EDA process:

**1. Data Cleaning:**

- Checked and handled missing values in columns like Age, Cabin, and Embarked.

- Dropped the Cabin column due to excessive missing values.

- Ensured the dataset was clean for analysis.

**2. Data Visualization:**

- Created various visualizations to uncover survival patterns:

- **Bar charts:** Showed survival counts by gender, class, and embarkation port.

- **Violin and box plots:** Compared age and fare distributions by survival status.

- **Scatter plots & heatmaps:** Explored relationships between multiple variables.

## Key Insights

* Females had a much higher survival rate compared to males.

* Passengers in 1st class survived at a much higher rate than those in lower classes.

* Passengers who paid higher fares were more likely to survive.

* Embarkation from Cherbourg (C) was associated with a higher survival rate.

* Age played a moderate role; children had higher survival rates in some classes.

## Conclusion
____________

This EDA process provided valuable insights üåü into the factors influencing passenger survival on the Titanic, setting a foundation for future predictive modeling.

üôè Thank you for reviewing my submission!
